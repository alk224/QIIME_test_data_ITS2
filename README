This is ITS2 mock community data I generated on a MiSeq.

Data has had phix contamination removed.

Data is paired end reads which have been joined.

I cultured everything myself (7 taxa). One of the taxa I think was contaminated.

Data has 3 reps per community. Use metadata category "Community" for analysis.
